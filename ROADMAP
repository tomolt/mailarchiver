# Roadmap

This document is intended to serve as a rough overview of what needs to be done.
Feel free to deviate from it for any reason.

## v0.4
- Generate index-sites per month.
  Messages on the sites are ordered by date in a simple table.

## v0.5
- Properly parse Message-IDs and From: fields with tokenize().
- Add thread navigation bar to the mail printouts.
- Use iconv() if needed (and available) to convert to UTF-8.

## v0.6
- Parse & understand MIME. Separate mail bodies from attachments.
  Write out attachments separately.

## v0.7
- Thread navigation on each mail HTML site.
  What do we do if the parent mail hasn't arrived yet (reversed order)?
  Perhaps push the current mail back / let it stay in new/ temporarily.
  (But when to give up on it?)

## v0.8
- Option to rescan cur/.
- Generate a site per-author.
- Generate overview site listing all the per-month sites.

## v1.0
Goal: As-good as hypermail for the purposes of the suckless mailing lists.
(Does not mean feature parity, just overall usability should be about the same!)

## after v1.0
- Generate Gopher *.gph sites
- Generate an Atom Feed
