# Roadmap

This document is intended to serve as a rough overview of what needs to be done.
Feel free to deviate from it for any reason.

## Do whenever
- Put files in www/ directory into subdirs to avoid filename collisions.
- Mangle e-mail addresses so that web scrapers won't recognize them.
- Properly track the set of files that have to be regenerated.
- Properly parse Message-IDs and From: fields.
- Option to rescan cur/.
- Massage HTML output so it's easier to style with CSS? (i.e. use classes, ids, etc.)
- Split project into multiple separate executables?
- Make cache file structure independent of system architecure? (meaning enforce byteorder etc.)

## v0.5
- Use iconv() if needed (and available) to convert to UTF-8.

## v0.6
- Parse & understand MIME. Separate mail bodies from attachments.
  Write out attachments separately.

## v0.7
- Thread navigation on each mail HTML site.
  What do we do if the parent mail hasn't arrived yet (reversed order)?
  Perhaps push the current mail back / let it stay in new/ temporarily.
  (But when to give up on it?)

## v0.8
- Generate a site per-author.
- Generate overview site listing all the per-month sites.

## v1.0
*Goal:* As-good as hypermail for the purposes of the suckless mailing lists.
(Does not mean feature parity, just overall usability should be about the same!)

## after v1.0
- Generate Gopher *.gph sites
- Generate an Atom Feed
