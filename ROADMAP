# Roadmap

This document is intended to serve as a rough overview of what needs to be done.
Feel free to deviate from it for any reason.

## v0.3
- Option to rescan cur/.
- Generating an index site. Can be a separate executable reading from a cache file.

## v0.4
- Stricter interpretation of some mail header fields.
- Thread navigation on index site.
- Convert ISO 8859-1 and Windows-1251 to UTF-8.
  (Both encodings occur occasionally on the suckless mailing lists)

## v0.5
- Parse & understand MIME. Separate mail bodies from attachments.
  Write out attachments separately.
- Thread navigation on each mail HTML site.
  If the parent mail hasn't arrived yet (reversed order),
  push the current mail back / let it stay in new/ temporarily.
  (But when to give up on it?)

## v0.6
- Split index site into multiple pages. Either per-month or by fixed number of mails
  per page.
- View per date?
- View per author?

## v1.0
Goal: As-good as hypermail for the purposes of the suckless mailing lists.
(Does not mean feature parity, just overall usability should be about the same!)

## after v1.0
- Generate Gopher *.gph sites
- Generate an Atom Feed
